Compiling on Mac
----------------
* Install Python on your Mac if necessary. The default python that comes with mac does not let numpy install, so better off installing it yourself. Get from python.org
* Install Eclipse
* Install PyDev for Eclipse
* Import the project into Eclipse
* Start off by installing numpy. If it does not install, then get and install the official python and don't use the apple one
* Then download matplotlib. Be sure to expand the files and search for dmg otherwise your will waste your time
* Download and install wxPython
* All this stuff will be using your new python, and eclipse is likely using the default python. Open eclipse and go select the new python you installed at a location like /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/bin
